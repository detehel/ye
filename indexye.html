    <!--- i used this color to match one of kanye's album covers and i used these resources: https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_styles_background-color and https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp. how could i make it change that color with every refresh to maybe shuffle through all the album cover colors? i have to think if i need it tho, maybe it gets annoying fast. -->

<!-- this should be a hyperlink maybe use <a href="theotherpage.html">The Link</a> thingy (from this tutorial here: https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/myfirstsite/basiclinks.html)  (or it could be a pic named image0.png that leads) to a folder /images/ that displays a random image from that folder when clicked. all the pics have name "image_.png" where "_" is a number and i have 3 test images right now, since i have not got around to making graphics yet-->

<!--  i tried to use <img src="/images/image_<?png $random = rand(1,3); echo $random; ?>.png" code from here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4478783/select-random-file-from-directory but i don't think it works. oh it's php, not html lol -->

<!-- oh i found another tutorial from here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50013591/random-image-on-html-refresh, testing now -->

<!-- ooops, still don't know how to do it. oh wait, is this a javascript thing? -->
